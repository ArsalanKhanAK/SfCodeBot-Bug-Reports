# üêû Bug Report: Successful Background Element Creation, but CodeBot Shows Error and No Validation Color

**Module:** Employee Profile  
**Sheet:** Background Elements  
**Tracking Request ID:** 7f037a4f73-4232284  
**Group ID:** 7f037a4f73-G6042943  

---

## Title
Object and data created successfully in instance, but CodeBot shows error in logs and no validation color appears in sheet

---

## Description
When executing automation for the **Background Elements** sheet, the object and its associated data are successfully created in the SAP instance.  
However, despite this success, the **CodeBot logs still display an error**, and the **validation row in the sheet remains uncolored**‚Äîneither green (success) nor red (failure).  
This inconsistency creates confusion regarding the actual result of the configuration.

---

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the **Background Elements** sheet.  
2. Add valid data for a new object.  
3. Run the automation/configuration using **CodeBot**.  
4. Check the following:  
   - SAP instance for object and data creation  
   - CodeBot logs  
   - Validation status (row color) in the sheet  

---

## Expected Result
- If the object and data are successfully created in the instance:
  - CodeBot logs should reflect a successful execution.
  - The corresponding row in the sheet should be **highlighted in green**.
- If there's a failure:
  - The logs should capture a **relevant error message**.
  - The corresponding row should be **highlighted in red**.

---

## Actual Result
- Object and data **are created successfully** in the SAP instance  
- **CodeBot logs still show an error**  
- **Validation color in the sheet is missing** (no green/red highlight)  

---

## Severity & Environment

- **Severity:** Medium (due to misleading or inconsistent feedback)  

- **Environment:**  
  - **Stage:** Testing Environment
